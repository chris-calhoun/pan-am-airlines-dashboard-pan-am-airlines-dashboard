# DESCRIPTION
 This project is called nutshell. We were tasked with finishing a half finished project on top of new requirments. The project was about making CRUD for a PanAm app. The new requirements were to be able to book flights with crew, meals (flights under 6hrs = snack, over 6hrs = snack, meal), destination, and your choice of plane. 

# MOTIVATION/CONTEXT
This project was completed as part of our portfolio at Nashville Software School. It was a collaborative effort that showcases our newly-acquired skills in using Firebase, Postman, and API's as well as relational databases.
